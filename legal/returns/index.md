<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>We want you to be happy with your BonnieByte PC products. If something isn’t right, this Returns &amp; Refund Policy explains how returns, refunds, and exchanges work.</p>
<p>This policy applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchases made through our official Amazon UK store</li>
<li>Future direct purchases made through our own online store (Shopify)</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Return Window</h2>
<p>You have up to <strong>30 days</strong> from the date you receive your product to request a return, in line with Amazon policies and general UK consumer expectations.</p>
<h2>3. Amazon Orders</h2>
<p>If you purchased your BonnieByte PC product from Amazon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please use Amazon’s returns system to initiate a return or refund</li>
<li>Amazon’s own Returns &amp; Refunds Policy applies</li>
<li>We are still happy to help with troubleshooting and warranty support</li>
</ul>
<p>Your first point of contact for Amazon orders should normally be the Amazon “Your Orders” page. If you have difficulty, you may also email us for guidance.</p>
<h2>4. Direct (Shopify) Orders – Eligibility</h2>
<p>The following applies to orders placed directly on our website (when available):</p>
<ul>
<li>Return requested within 30 days of delivery</li>
<li>Product in “as new” or “reasonable” condition</li>
<li>All major accessories included (hub, fans, key cables)</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.1 Condition of Returned Items</h3>
<p>Please ensure items are clean, safely packaged, and free from heavy damage.</p>
<p>Refunds may be reduced where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major components are missing</li>
<li>There is obvious misuse or damage beyond normal handling</li>
<li>Packaging is destroyed or heavily damaged (unless caused by transit issues)</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Non-Returnable Items</h2>
<p>We generally accept returns for most products. However, we may not accept returns where:</p>
<ul>
<li>A product has been severely physically damaged by misuse</li>
<li>Essential components are missing or destroyed</li>
<li>The product has been modified (e.g., cables cut, PCBs altered)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your statutory rights are not affected. If a product is faulty or not as described, you may still be entitled to a repair, replacement, or refund under UK consumer law.</p>
<h2>6. Faulty or Defective Products</h2>
<p>If your product is faulty, defective, or not working as expected, please contact us as soon as possible. Many issues can be resolved with quick troubleshooting. If the product is genuinely faulty, you are protected by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our <strong>2-year Limited Warranty</strong></li>
<li>Your statutory rights under UK consumer law</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event of a confirmed fault, we may offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacement of the defective component (e.g., a single fan or cable)</li>
<li>Replacement of the entire bundle where appropriate</li>
<li>A refund where repair or replacement is not possible</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. How to Request a Return (Direct Orders)</h2>
<p>For direct orders (when available), please email:</p>
<p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:orders@bonniebytepc.com">orders@bonniebytepc.com</a></p>
<p>Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>Order number</li>
<li>Reason for return</li>
<li>Photos or video of any fault (if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>We will reply with next steps, which may include troubleshooting, return authorisation, or a replacement plan.</p>
<h2>8. Refund Process</h2>
<p>Once we receive and inspect your returned item, we will email you to confirm whether your refund has been approved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Approved refunds are issued to your original payment method</li>
<li>Processing times depend on your bank or payment provider</li>
<li>If only a partial refund is appropriate, we will explain the reason clearly</li>
</ul>
<h2>9. Return Shipping Costs</h2>
<h3>9.1 Change of Mind / No Fault Found</h3>
<p>If you change your mind or the product is unsuitable, you may be responsible for return shipping costs unless required otherwise by law.</p>
<h3>9.2 Faulty, Damaged, or Incorrect Items</h3>
<p>If your item is faulty, damaged in transit, or incorrect, we will normally provide a pre-paid return label or reimburse reasonable return shipping costs.</p>
<h2>10. Exchanges</h2>
<p>In many cases, an exchange will be processed as a refund plus a new order:</p>
<ul>
<li>We refund your original purchase</li>
<li>You place a new order for the desired item</li>
</ul>
<p>For faulty items, we may offer a direct like-for-like replacement instead of requiring a new order.</p>
<h2>11. Your Consumer Rights</h2>
<p>Nothing in this policy affects your statutory rights. UK consumer law gives you the right to a repair, replacement, or refund if a product is faulty, not as described, or not fit for purpose.</p>
