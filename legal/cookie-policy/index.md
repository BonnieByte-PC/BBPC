<h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
<p>
    Cookies are small text files stored on your device to help websites function and remember your
    preferences. Under UK GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR),
    <strong>essential cookies</strong> may be used without consent, while analytics, advertising, or tracking
    cookies require your explicit permission.
</p>
<h2>2. Cookies We Use</h2>
<p>
    BonnieByte PC currently uses <strong>only essential cookies</strong>. These are required for security, basic
    functionality, accessibility features, and remembering your preferences.
</p>
<h3>2.1 Essential Cookies (No Consent Required)</h3>
<p>The following cookies are required for our website to operate correctly:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>bb_cookie_consent</strong> – Remembers whether you accepted or rejected optional cookies. <em>Duration:</em> 6–12 months.</li>
    <li><strong>bb_theme</strong> – Stores your light/dark theme preference. <em>Duration:</em> 6–12 months.</li>
    <li><strong>bb_session_id</strong> – Creates an anonymous session identifier for site functions. <em>Duration:</em> Session only.</li>
    <li><strong>bb_csrf</strong> – Security token used to protect forms from abuse. <em>Duration:</em> Session only.</li>
    <li><strong>bb_lang</strong> – Saves language/region preferences for future localisation. <em>Duration:</em> 6–12 months.</li>
    <li><strong>bb_banner_*</strong> – Remembers when you dismiss operational notices (e.g., maintenance or shipping alerts) so that they are not repeatedly shown. <em>Duration:</em> 1–30 days.</li>
    <li><strong>bb_support_origin</strong> – Remembers the page you were on before opening the Support page, helping us provide smoother navigation. <em>Duration:</em> 1 day.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These cookies do <strong>not</strong> identify you, track you, or share data with any third parties.
    They exist exclusively to provide a smooth, secure browsing experience.
</p>
<h3>2.2 Functional Cookies</h3>
<p>
    Functional cookies help the website remember your settings (such as theme or language). 
    All functional cookies currently used by BonnieByte PC are also classified as essential, as they provide 
    accessibility support and core usability.
</p>
<h3>2.3 Analytics Cookies</h3>
<p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> use analytics tools such as Google Analytics, Matomo, or tracking pixels.
</p>
<p>
    If we introduce optional analytics in the future—for example, when our online store launches—you will be asked to provide explicit consent before they are enabled.
</p>
<h3>2.4 Advertising or Tracking Cookies</h3>
<p>
    BonnieByte PC does <strong>not</strong> use advertising cookies, behavioural tracking technologies, 
    social media pixels, or retargeting tools.
</p>
<h2>3. Managing Cookies</h2>
<p>You can manage cookies on our website in several ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Browser settings:</strong> Most browsers allow you to block or delete cookies. This will not impact essential cookies on our site but may limit functionality on other websites.</li>
    <li><strong>Cookie banner:</strong> On your first visit, you may choose to accept or reject optional cookies. Since we currently use only essential cookies, rejecting optional cookies has no negative effect.</li>
    <li><strong>Reset cookie preferences:</strong> You can reset your decision using the button below.  
        <br>
        <button id="bbpc-scroll-to-reset" class="button button-secondary">↓</button>
        <br>
        This removes your existing preference and re-shows the cookie banner on your next visit.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Footer link:</strong> You can also reset cookie preferences at any time via the “Change Cookie Settings” link in the site footer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If we introduce analytics or non-essential cookies in the future, these tools give you full control to
    withdraw consent at any time.
</p>
<p>
    Rejecting optional cookies will never prevent you from using our website.
</p>
<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<h3>4.1 MailerLite Newsletter Forms</h3>
<p>
    Our newsletter signup form uses MailerLite. MailerLite may process the data you enter (e.g., your email)
    to deliver the signup form securely, but it does <strong>not</strong> load marketing or tracking cookies on
    our site unless you explicitly consent to optional analytics in the future.
</p>
<h3>4.2 Google reCAPTCHA</h3>
<p>
    Some forms may use Google reCAPTCHA to protect against spam and automated abuse. reCAPTCHA may set 
    <em>strictly necessary</em> cookies such as <code>rc::a</code> and <code>rc::b</code>. These are 
    used solely for security and not for marketing or advertising.
</p>
<h3>4.3 Hosting Platform</h3>
<p>
    Our site is hosted on GitHub Pages, which sets <strong>no cookies</strong> for normal visitors and does not 
    process personal data on our behalf.
</p>
<h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
    Any updates to this policy will appear here with the date included.

<h2 id="bbpc-reset-section">6. Change or Withdraw Your Cookie Decision</h2>
<p>
    You may change or withdraw your cookie preference at any time. Clicking the button below resets your
    cookie decision and will show the cookie banner again on your next visit.
</p>
<button id="bbpc-reset-cookie-consent" class="button">
    Reset Cookie Preferences
</button>
<p>
    This ensures you can easily modify your consent if we introduce optional analytics or non-essential
    features in the future.
