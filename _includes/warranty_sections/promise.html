<h2>Our Warranty Promise</h2>
<p>
  We design BonnieByte PC products to perform reliably in real-world builds — from quiet airflow setups
  to heavily-overclocked rigs. If something goes wrong within the warranty period and it’s our fault,
  we’ll make it right.
</p>

<p>
  That means:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clear communication</li>
  <li>Fast assessment</li>
  <li>Fair resolutions</li>
  <li>No hidden terms or confusing fine print</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Our goal is simple: keep your PC running smoothly and make the warranty process as stress-free as possible.
