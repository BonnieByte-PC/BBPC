<h2>7. What We Will Do</h2>
<p>If your issue is covered under this warranty, we will take one of the following actions:</p>
<h3>Component Replacement (Most Common)</h3>
<p>If only one fan, cable, or the controller hub is faulty, we will replace that individual component.</p>
<p>This approach is faster, reduces unnecessary waste, and avoids returning a fully working bundle.</p>
<h3>Multiple Component Failure</h3>
<p>If two or more components from the same kit fail, we may replace the entire Northern Wind 120 bundle.</p>
<h3>Dead on Arrival (DOA) — First 30 Days</h3>
<p>If your bundle arrives with major faults that prevent normal use, we will replace the entire bundle at no cost.</p>
<h3>Refunds</h3>
<p>If a repair or replacement is not possible, we may issue a refund for the original purchase price.</p>
<h3>Replacement ETA</h3>
<p>Approved replacements are normally dispatched within <strong>1 working day</strong>.</p>
