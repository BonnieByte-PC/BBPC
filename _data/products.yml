    - Windows & Linux compatible
  faq:
    - question: Do these fans support PWM fan control?
      answer: Yes. All Northern Wind 120 fans use standard 4-pin PWM control and can be adjusted via BIOS or motherboard software.
    - question: Are the fans noisy at full speed?
      answer: No. The fans are tuned for quiet operation, even at higher RPMs, with a balanced airflow-to-noise profile.
    - question: Is an ARGB hub included in the box?
      answer: Yes. Each kit includes a magnetic ARGB hub for simplified cable management and lighting control.
    - question: Can I sync the lighting with my motherboard software?
      answer: Yes. The fans support 5V 3-pin ARGB and are compatible with ASUS Aura Sync, MSI Mystic Light, and Gigabyte RGB Fusion.
    - question: Will these fans work on Linux?
      answer: Yes. Fan speed control works at the BIOS level, so operating system does not affect basic functionality.
    - question: Can I mix these fans with other ARGB fans?
      answer: You can mix them electrically, but visual colour matching may vary between brands.

  faq:
    - question: How many fans can I connect to this hub?
      answer: You can connect up to 5 PWM fans and 5 ARGB devices simultaneously.
    - question: Does the hub require external power?
      answer: Yes. The hub uses SATA power to ensure stable power delivery to connected fans and lighting.
    - question: Can I control fan speed from my motherboard?
      answer: Yes. PWM fan speed is passed through from the motherboard to all connected fans.
    - question: Is this hub compatible with all motherboards?
      answer: The hub is compatible with most modern motherboards that support 12V PWM and 5V ARGB headers.
    - question: Does the hub remember lighting settings?
      answer: Lighting behaviour depends on your motherboard or controller software rather than the hub itself.

  faq:
    - question: How many fans can I connect using this splitter?
      answer: You can connect one fan per male connector on the splitter.
    - question: Will all connected fans spin at the same speed?
      answer: Yes. All connected fans receive the same PWM control signal from the motherboard.
    - question: Is this splitter safe to use with high-power fans?
      answer: It is designed for standard PC case fans. Avoid exceeding your motherboard header’s power limits.
    - question: Does this splitter support RGB lighting?
      answer: No. This splitter only carries PWM fan control signals and power.
    - question: Can I use this with a fan hub instead of a motherboard header?
      answer: Yes. It works with both motherboard PWM headers and compatible fan hubs.
